TouchGrid
=========

A test app to check the touch screen sensor

Basic idea:
- Draw a mxn grid on screen
- Capture the touch event
- Support multitouch
- Mark a grid block when touched
- Draw the rect to represent the touch box

Additional:
- Show the press size
- Show pressure
- Make the grid overlay?
- Make block size configurable?

Update 2012/11/13:
Pending issue: 
- drawing is flickering while touch
- use of thread seem to lag behind the touch
